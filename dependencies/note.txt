I do not own spigot or vault I take no credit for the dependencies just put them here to make it easier instead of downloading them also
server has to be 1.8

which I included spigot for.

also on the other note

these plugins are actually really bad they don't cache, nothin and its terrible the way it saves but hey go right ahead and do whatever u want with em.
